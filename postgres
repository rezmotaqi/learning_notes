when postgres is installed, user "postgres" in automatically created

to login you have to su to "postgres" user (as noted in docs, to login in postgres the user must not be root,
and as default there is the "postgres" user which you have to su in order to access postgres interactive terminal)

so it like this, after installing the db,
sudo su postgres

password problem = if db is up in docker you can inspect container and after su postgres, use psql to open postgres terminal
and then use ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'myPassword';
to set password for user.
if operation is successful ALTER ROLE is returned in terminal.

psql -> postgres terminal is opened, sql queried can be used here, as well as postgres commands

like:
    \d table_name	Describe a table such as a column, type, modifiers of columns, etc.


    \dt	List available tables

    \l	List available databases
