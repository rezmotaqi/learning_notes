when postgres is installed, user "postgres" in automatically created

to login you have to su to "postgres" user (as noted in docs, to login in postgres the user must not be root,
and as default there is the "postgres" user which you have to su in order to access postgres interactive terminal)

so it like this, after installing the db,
sudo su postgres
psql -> postgres terminal is opened, sql queried can be used here, as well as postgres commands

like:
    \d table_name	Describe a table such as a column, type, modifiers of columns, etc.


    \dt	List available tables

    \l	List available databases
